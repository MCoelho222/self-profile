    welcome: "Hello, and welcome to my profile! ðŸš€ Here, you'll find the key milestones of my professional journey. \
    Currently, my goal is to work with AI models, data analysis, and web development, combining technology and innovation to create \
    impactful solutions. Letâ€™s connect and exchange ideas!",
    aboutMe: 
    "I am a Brazilian software developer specializing in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript. Currently, I work at an international company \
    training AI-based models for generating various types of code in Python. Recently, I completed a postgraduate degree where I \
    was able to deepen my knowledge in the incredible world of artificial intelligence, using libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, \
    PyTorch, and Pandas.\n\n A major differentiator in my skills as a developer is my background in environmental engineering, including \
    a PhD focused on statistical analysis of environmental data using Python. This academic foundation has provided me with solid knowledge \
    in statistics, mathematics, and computer programming, as well as excellent logical reasoning and a critical approach to problem-solving.\n\n Since \
    my career transition in 2021, I have worked on diverse technology projects, mainly using Python and Flask for REST API development, PostgreSQL/PostGIS \
    for databases, Docker containers in a distributed microservices system, RabbitMQ for event-driven systems, GeoServer for mapping applications, \
    and JavaScript/TypeScript with React and Vue.js for user interface development.\n\n I have gained considerable experience with unit testing and CI/CD\
     pipelines in Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure environments, as well as with agile methodologies such as Scrum. Thanks to my background in engineering \
     and statistical data analysis, I have always been able to contribute with refined code reviews regarding mathematical rules and logical reasoning, \
     ensuring high-performance and error-free deliveries.\n\n Other skills and personal characteristics: advanced English (reading, writing, and speaking), \
     self-managing, organized, collaborative, communicative, detail-oriented, and always eager to enhance my knowledge.",
