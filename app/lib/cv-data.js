    "I am a fullstack web developer and environmental engineer with doctorate degree. \
    Currently, I work with python for training AI-based models for generating code for data analysis. \
    As a fullstack web developer I have worked with python, flask, typescript and react mainly. \
    As an engineer I have a long experience using python for data analysis and a strong mathematical and statistical knowledge.\
    To keep learning and improving my capabilities, I'm pursuing a postgraduate in artificial intelligence. \
    Besides, I am self managing, collaborative, communicative, open to learn, detail-oriented and determined.",
