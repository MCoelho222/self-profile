    welcome: "Hello, welcome to my profile! Here, you'll find I complete description of my professional tragetory. But who am I, right? \
    I am a simple guy who is passionate about nature, music and programming. I have two kids, live close to the beach, and\
    when things goes wrong, I just keep calm and positive and everything gets back to the track.",
    aboutMe: 
    "I am a full-stack developer and environmental engineer with strong expertise in statistical data analysis. \
    I worked as a professor in higher education for undergraduate courses in Environmental Engineering from 2013 until 2021, \
    when I decided to transition my career. Since then, I have been involved in diverse projects in the technology sector, \
    primarily using Python and Flask to develop REST APIs (backend), including databases in Postgres/PostGIS. Additionally, \
    I work with JavaScript/TypeScript using React and Vue.js on the frontend. \
    I have gained considerable experience with unit testing and CI/CD pipelines in Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure environments, \
    as well as with agile methodologies such as SCRUM. \
    My foundation in engineering and statistical data analysis allows me to contribute refined code reviews focused on mathematical rules and logical reasoning, \
    ensuring high-performance and error-free deliveries. Currently, \
    I am training models based on artificial intelligence to generate code for data analysis and studying for a postgraduate degree in artificial intelligence. \
    I am proficient in English, self-managed, collaborative, communicative, detail-oriented, and always looking to expand my knowledge.",
