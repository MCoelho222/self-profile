    aboutMe: 
    "Brazilian software developer with strong expertise in Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.\
     I combine a solid background in environmental engineering (PhD) and AI (postgrad) with experience in developing REST APIs (Flask),\
      working with PostgreSQL/PostGIS, Docker, RabbitMQ, and cloud environments (GCP, Azure). I’ve contributed to microservices, mapping \
      platforms, and data-heavy applications, always focusing on clean, efficient, and logically sound code. \
      Skilled in AI tools like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, and familiar with frontend frameworks like React and Vue. \
      Strong in English, self-driven, collaborative, and detail-oriented.",
